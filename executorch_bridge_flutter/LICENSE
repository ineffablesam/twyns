This Flutter plugin does not modify ExecuTorch source code. It provides a
bridge to load and execute ExecuTorch-compatible `.pte` models. All rights,
trademarks, and intellectual property belong to their respective owners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hugging Face Models & Tokenizers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This project may load user-provided models or tokenizers originating from
Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co).

This project DOES NOT include or redistribute any:

- Pretrained large language models
- Tokenizers
- Hugging Face assets
- Gemma, Phi, Mistral, Llama, or other proprietary model weights
- ExecuTorch binaries beyond those allowed by platform distributions

Developers must ensure they hold redistribution rights for any model files
they package with their app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
This project provides only the technical mechanism to run ExecuTorch-based
models. The authors are not responsible for:

- The behavior, accuracy, or safety of any loaded model
- Any misuse or harmful output of AI models
- Violations of third-party licenses by downstream developers
- Compliance with local regulations or usage restrictions

All AI output should be reviewed for safety and used responsibly.
